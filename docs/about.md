## Overall motivation

As L2 learners of the Thai language, our needs are not always served by general public resources, they also differs by individual, situations, and over time as learning progresses. There are resources for the Thai language, adequate if sparse, but many are produced and maintained (or not) by individuals whose life may get in the way. More community cooperation is needed. Here is our bit.

## Sustainability of resources

Resources for Thai L2 learners are sparse and not well organised. 

Some of the best resources depends on the personal effort of heroic individuals: Glenn, Mike, Belisan, etc. Unfortunately this is not sustainable. 

At the time of writing, thai-language.com is under, as one of the power supplies packed up. The 70k dictionary, the examples sentences, the audio files, classifiers, categories, articles, software to transliterate or find by sound, etc., are not lost. The non-dynamic one are available at the web-archive. But the future is uncertain.

Thai2English.com stats 'the fees are currently covered until September 2024', now is Oct.2025. The critical pages 'Terms Of Use' & 'Privacy Policy', which were obviously subcontracted, are now 404, as likely unpaid. The bottom states: Copyright Â© 2024 thai2english.com. We have not received responses from the author. Contrary to thai-language.com, Thai2English is safe from LLM... but that also means that both its sofware **and** data might disappear tomorrow.

Volubilis has severe data quality issues, and the main author informed us that his time is sparse. 

TLTK is no longer maintained in github. 

pythainlp has some of its key functions (tone detection, etc.) in bug hell, and the maintainer has been calling for help.

A new site is offering much (and frankly looks promising), thai-notes.com, but it also seems to be the affaire of a couple. Its licensing of the data is also unclear.

We need a more collective, open source based approach to maintain the common resources.
