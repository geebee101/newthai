## Utilities and resources for Thai adult learners.

As L2 learners of the Thai language, our needs are not always served by general public resources, they also differs by individual, situations, and over time as learning progresses. There are resources for the Thai language, adequate if sparse, but many are produced and maintained (or not) by individuals whose life may get in the way. More community cooperation is needed. Here is our bit.
