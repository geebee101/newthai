For instance, the English morphological system \u2014though simpler than German\u2014 still creates more distinct forms than Thai.</li> <li>Absence of Colonial Expansion/Borrowing: While English vocabulary has been exponentially expanded by a colonial history, large empire, and acceptance of loanwords, Thai has a different historical trajectory. The development of modern Thai lexicography (starting with the first monolingual dictionary in 1873) was more linked to internal socio-political developments and foreign missionary influence, resulting in a more focused, often prescriptive approach by the Royal Institute, which traditionally resists massive foreign borrowings.</li> <li>Lexicographical Inconsistency (Internal Thai Factor): The initial observation that the major Thai dictionaries only share 25\u201330% of their words may point to a lack of standardized corpus-based lexicography or a more fundamental difference in what various Thai authorities deem \"authoritative,\" contributing to the lower total count and fragmented consensus.</li> </ul> <p>Toward a v.3 of the list?</p> <p>The superset of the core 4, as well as TLC, and words extracted from wikipedia, all have around 65-70k words.
